# Enable reading list on Android

1. Type `chrome://flags#read-later` and select the "Enabled (with app menu item)" option. A "Reading List" item will now appear in the Bookmarks menu and a website can be added to the reading list by pressing on the "Add to reading list" app menu item.
2. Type `chrome://flags#bookmark-bottom-sheet` and select the "Enabled" option. This setting, combined with `read-later,` adds a "Reading list - Save this page for later and get a reminder" menu item to the bottom sheet or drawer that is opened when the ⭐️ button is pressed.
